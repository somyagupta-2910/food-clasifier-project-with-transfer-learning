- To implement Transfer Learning and Data Augmentation techniques to enhance model performance without the need for an extensive dataset.
- To improve upon the accuracy of previous models for a more reliable classification outcome.

## Methodology
### Transfer Learning
We employed Transfer Learning to capitalize on the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model, known for its efficiency and accuracy in image recognition tasks, including a diverse range of food categories. This approach allowed us to achieve a high degree of accuracy with limited computational resources and training time.

### Data Augmentation
To further enhance the model's ability to generalize across various food images, we implemented Data Augmentation techniques. By applying transformations such as rotation, zoom, and horizontal flipping, we significantly increased the diversity of our training dataset, leading to improved model robustness and performance.

## Results
The implementation of Transfer Learning and Data Augmentation techniques resulted in a substantial improvement in the model's accuracy. The Enhanced Food Classification System achieved an accuracy of **86%**, a notable increase from the previous model's accuracy of **76%**. This improvement demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in developing a more accurate and reliable food classification system.

## Conclusion
The Enhanced Food Classification System represents a significant step forward in the field of food recognition. By leveraging advanced techniques such as Transfer Learning and Data Augmentation, coupled with the efficiency of the MobileNetV2 model, we have successfully developed a system that offers high accuracy and reliability.
